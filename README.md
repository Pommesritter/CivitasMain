Civitas is supposed to be a RPG gameserver interface project to create and manage the game world, player lists, authentication, leveling curves, trading, game dynamics etc.

CivitasMain is the core element of this interface, providing a filesystem (german "Dateisystem"), aswell as it comes with all the saveable classes which can be used by Server plugins.
