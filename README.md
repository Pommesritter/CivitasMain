## Description

The core Software of project Civitas. 
It aims to:
- create and maintain the game worlds where all the action shall be going on
- Save and load game files 
- Provide the basic calculations which will be used to check certain cool things (like "is object1 within range of NPC1 ...)

Remark that all functions of this software are about processing data. The game client will should written in C++, and for user authentication there must be additional software aswell. But - step after step. 

About the client: Writing a whole game client is an ambitious thing to do. Therefore it might be a possibility to first create a spigot plugin which hooks into a Civitas Server (it would be made so that the Spigot server itself is a client of Civitas...). This would provide an environment for testing out the software.

Also note that this project started in german and will be Refractor'd into english step by step.
