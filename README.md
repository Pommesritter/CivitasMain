# The Civitas server project

CivitasServer is supposed to be an **RPG gameserver interface** which creates and manages the game world, player lists, authentication, leveling curves, trading, game dynamics etc.


CivitasMain is the core element of this interface, providing a filesystem (german "Dateisystem"), aswell as it comes with all the saveable classes which can be used by Server plugins.
